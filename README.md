## Associated with Technological University of the Philippines

This system is part of our capstone project entitled e-Serbisyo: BARANGAY CUPANG INFORMATION DISSEMINATION AND CERTIFICATE ISSUANCE SYSTEM. The main point of creating this system is to allow barangay Cupang organization to centralize their data and make the services available online. This pandemic proves that digital services are now a trend to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus.

The website application is for admin officials in the barangay Cupang. However, it can also be used by the residents to view the landing page, download the android application, and register. The login function in the website application will restrict any user without admin privileges. Overall this web application serves as a way for admin officials to conduct their services and make the data centralized.

Some functions of this website:
- Post announcements
- Approved certificate request
- Respond to the report submitted by the resident thru the e- Serbisyo android application
- Dashboards for a different set of admins
- Approved or Denied Missing Person/Item request sent by the resident

These are the list of technologies used in creating the web application
- Laravel 8
- PHP
- HTML
- JavaScript
- jQuery
